# Cybersecurity datasets

Attackers demonstrate the performance of their adversarial attacks based on different datasets and victim models. This brings obstacles to objectively evaluating the adversarial attacks and measuring the robustness of deep learning models. In particular, large and high-quality datasets usually make it hard for adversaries/defenders to attack/defend. In this subsection, we provide an overview of the most prominent datasets employed in building DL-based defense systems and using adversarial machine learning approaches in the cybersecurity domain, organized per specific application/category. Herein, we can find a curated list of cybersecurity datasets.
